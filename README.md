# git-collab-class
oreilly git collaboration class with Daniel Chen, 2020-10-07

First we make a repository on github, and then we clone onto
the local system...
   cd 
   mkdir git
   cd git
   git clone https://github.com/bostonannex/git-collab-class

git branch my_branch

creates a new branch at the head called my_branch
